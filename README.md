# MakeupInventory
Android App, written in Kotlin. Uses a SQL Lite DB to store user entered makeup items, used to inventory a person's makeup collection to identify shades, expiry, brand, etc.  

Swatch Book is a makeup inventory app. When you input the product into your inventory, you can record the category- blush, eyeshadow, etc.-, shade, brand, date opened, expected expiry, and you can take a picture as well, so you can see the exact shade/packaging. Youâ€™ll never end up buying a shade of lipstick that you have ten of at home. You can bring your makeup collection to the store with you, with Swatch Book.
